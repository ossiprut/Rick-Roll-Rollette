# Rick-Roll-Roulette
This is made by chatGPT (blackbox.ai) please insert it onto a usb thump drive and make it to a DIY fun maker btw the rollette system is NOT 1 out of 6 why? it doesn't remove the last number from the wheel of luck. Thats why it can go up to like 10 tabs before anything happens.

This is a chrome extension so it will only work on chromium based broswers.

How do I install RRR? go to chrome://extensions in a new tab and then enable devloper mode. now you need to download the extension click on the code button then click on the zip
ones downloaded open unzip the file and then go back to the chrome extensions tab and click load unpacked and then select the unzipped folder of the file then enable the extension.
